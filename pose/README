In order to run the Python scripts, you'll need to either setup a Python
virtual environment and install the packages described within 
requirements.txt within it, or install the requirements.txt packages directly 
on your system.

These instructions assume you are using Python3, pip3, and have the venv
package installed (python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv)

To setup the Python virtual environment, run the following commaands:

python3 -m venv venv		# to create the virtual environment

. venv/bin/activate		# to 'enter' the virtual environment

pip3 install wheel 		# to install wheel (which is needed by
				#  some of the other packages in
				#  requirements.txt, so it needs to be
				#  installed first)

pip3 install -r requirements.txt # Install the packages listed in
				 # requirements.txt

To install the packages on your system directly (as opposed to using a virtual 
environment, use pip3 to install wheel first and then pip3 with -r to install the requirements.txt packages

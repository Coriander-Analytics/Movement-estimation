To run:
    - Create python3 virtual environment via:
        python3 -m venv env
    in the terminal (assuming you have both python3 and the venv module installed)

    - Activate the virtual environment via:
        . env/bin/activate
    in the terminal

    - Once inside the environment (shell prompt should be prepended with '(env)'),
    run:
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    - Once all packages are downloaded you're all set!
